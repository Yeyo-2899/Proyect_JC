Just Cook is a cooking recipe website where people can save and vote for recipes that are their favorites.

The website was developed using SCSS to implement a style management system. Additionally, Vue.JS was used for the implementation of reactive components.

The backend of the site was developed using Laravel from a local server. This allowed us to create a local API which was consumed by the Axios implementation thanks to Vue.
